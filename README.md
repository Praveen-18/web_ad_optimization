# Web Ad Optimization using Machine Learning - Django Integration

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

This project aims to optimize web advertisements using machine learning techniques and integrates the solution into a Django web application. The application allows users to submit a CSV file containing ad performance data, and it generates a bar chart graph to visualize the results.

## Features

- CSV File Submission: Users can submit a CSV file containing ad performance data.
- Data Processing: The application processes the submitted CSV file to extract relevant information.
- Machine Learning Optimization: The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize web advertisements based on the provided data.
- Bar Chart Visualization: The application generates a bar chart graph to visualize the optimized ad performance.

## Technologies Used

- Django: A Python-based web framework used for developing the web application.
- Machine Learning Libraries: Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch are used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Data Visualization Libraries: Libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly are used for generating bar chart graphs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2.Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.Configure the Django project:
```
cd project_directory
cp .env.example .env
```

4.Run database migrations:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

5.Start the Django development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

6.Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

## Usage
- Open the web application in your browser.
- Submit a CSV file containing ad performance data.
- Wait for the application to process the data and generate the optimized results.
- The optimized ad performance will be displayed in a bar chart graph.
